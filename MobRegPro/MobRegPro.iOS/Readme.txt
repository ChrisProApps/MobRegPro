Starting from iOS10, you need to set the permission requests in info.plist

Add permissions for almost everything in info.plist, goto source tab, add entry, select key from dropdown
	see PDF :  New iOS 10 Privacy Permission Settings | Xamrin Blog.pdf

If not done then App will terminate on startup, no exceptions no error messages
